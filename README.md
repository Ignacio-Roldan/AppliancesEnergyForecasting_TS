# COSC2793_s3823943_Ass2
Computational Machine Learning - Assignment 2 - Project 2 Code Submission.

This repository contains the code used for assignment 2. This work discuss project alternative 2: Predict Energy Use.

The approach taken is explained inside the code, and it includes: 

- EDA of the dataset, 
- data preprocessing, 
- evaluation of a Random Forest,
- evaluation of a XGBoost, and
- analysis of removing lag features.
